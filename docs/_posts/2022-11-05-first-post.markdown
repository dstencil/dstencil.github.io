You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Create a folder for where you are going to save your docker image.

{% highlight console %}
mkdir docker
{% endhighlight %}

Enter Folder

{% highlight console %}
cd docker
{% endhighlight %}
